README FOR PROJ 1

Group Members:
ZEQUN YU  
YUNSHU GAO
YIKAI CHEN

Here are 5 parts of the whole project. We discussed together and share thoughts
before we start coding. After many times meeting, Yikai starts working on part
1, Yunshu starts working on part 2, Zequn starts working on part 3. And then we
meet again to discuss and debug together for these three parts. Then we working
on part 4 and part 5 together in lab.
Finally we believe our code works as what we expect, we also write our own test
cases and ask suggestion from tutors to make sure our code work correctly. I
think each member in group contributes evenly effort on our project, because for
many weird bugs we think and discuss together to solve them, and we coding and
debugging for most part of this project.
