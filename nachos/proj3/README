Here are two parts of this project, we spent a lot of time on it. We use our own machine and lab machine for coding, testing and debugging. When we finish each part of code, we follow the instruction to debugging and write some personal debugging file when we finish it, and the it works as what we expect. Each member distribute his effort on this project.
