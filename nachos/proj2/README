Here are 3 parts in total of this project. We read the write-up seperately and meeting at afternoon or night to coding together. We asked TA for help during the lab hour when we can't figure out some weird bugs and finally the whole code looks  good now. Each member contributes their effort on this project, and project works as what we expect now.
